# EDA of Factors Affecting Home Price in Colorado


# Proposal
The aim of our project is to explore the patterns in the real estate market, mainly house price, with relation to the area that the houses are located. We’ll examine relationships between house price and different variables such as proximity to parks, access to healthcare, schools in the area, ect. We aim to do our analysis on the state of Colorado by using large data sets and access to API's such as Zillow Group Home - Data and APIs.
